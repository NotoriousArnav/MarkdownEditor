## Getting Started
To get started with Yame, open [Yame](https://notoriousarnav.github.io/MarkdownEditor/) in your browser. If you are using **Chromium based Browsers** you can install it straight from the browser, regardless of the OS/Platform you are on. 

## Features

- ~Meth~ Math Support
- File Sharing Support ( Thanks [@hect1k](https://github.com/hect1k) ) )
- Allows exporting to PDF and HTML
- Minimal and Lightweight (debatable, but atleast its lighter than ur mom)
- No Server-side dependencies (Really)
- Autosave
- Toggle Preview Mode using URL bar, just add `?preview=true` to the URL
- Fetch Remote file with `?fetchFrom=theUrl`
- File Open, Local and Remote
- PWA Support, so you can just Install the App from the Browser it self!

## TODOS:
- **MAIN FOCUS** Extensions Support to allow devs to make custom extensions and add them to the editor
- Multi File Support to allow multiple tabs and allow Notebook like functionality like Obsidian **Sometimes I think this is unnecessary**
- Allow custom themes **Yeah man, this is a TODO**
- Allow changing Code Block Themes
- Add more Markdown flavors
- Get a Nice Logo **Important**
