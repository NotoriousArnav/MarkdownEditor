- Toggle Preview Mode using URL bar, just add `?preview=true` to the URL

## TODOS:
- **MAIN FOCUS RIGHT NOW** PWA Support especially for Android and Chrome OS Devices like Chromebooks and Android Tablets
- **MAIN FOCUS** Extensions Support to allow devs to make custom extensions and add them to the editor
- File Sharing Support to allow sharing Markdown content as mini websites **Trying but failing to do, because I hate centralization**
- Multi File Support to allow multiple tabs and allow Notebook like functionality like Obsidian **Sometimes I think this is unnecessary**
- Allow custom themes **Yeah man, this is a TODO**
- Allow changing Code Block Themes
- Add more Markdown flavors
- Get a Nice Logo **Important**
